### UI Related (Check with Ketan)

- we'll keep only three sections on screen
  - LEFT
    - Code
    - Output
  - RIGHT
    - Explanation
- Two nav bars one on the header one on the left hand side
  - Nav in heder will contain [{search: ['language selection', 'data-structure list', 'algorithm list'], feedback }]
